## Overview
ElectiAssist addresses challenges of misinformation and lack of trust in electoral processes by providing a secure, informative, and user-friendly platform. This app enables users to explore candidate proposals, simulate voting outcomes, and receive accurate answers to frequently asked questions about voting. Data protection and user experience are prioritized through secure storage and a responsive interface.

## Program Structure
ElectiAssist is structured into several core components, each utilizing specific tools and technologies:

1. Presentation (User Interface): Developed using Flutter, ensuring a seamless and visually engaging experience for users on mobile platforms.
2. Business Logic:
   - Utilizes state management solutions like Bloc/Cubit, Provider, GetX, and Redux for efficient application state handling.
3. Data Access:
   - Data is managed via SQLite, with sqflite for database connectivity and persistence.
4. Software Architecture:
   - Ensures smooth integration with external HTTP connections and plugins.
5. Security:
   - Data is safeguarded using `flutter_secure_storage` to ensure user privacy and data integrity.
6. Server and Infrastructure:
   - External HTTP connections facilitate secure communication with remote servers, with necessary support from Flutter plugins.
7. Data Integrity and Functionality:
   - Ensures accurate data consistency across users with SQLite, and functionality is verified for each UI component to perform as intended.

## Features
- AI-powered Chatbot: An AI-driven chatbot responds to voter questions, providing quick, relevant information on electoral procedures, candidates, and voting logistics.
- Voting Simulation: Allows users to participate in an anonymous voting simulation, showcasing current electoral trends based on user inputs.
- Proposal Lookup: Provides organized access to candidate proposals, filtered by party and electoral position.
- Data Security: Utilizes secure data storage and encryption to protect user information and maintain confidentiality.

## Architecture
ElectiAssist is built with a layered architecture that separates the user interface, business logic, and data management. This architecture is designed for scalability, maintainability, and ease of testing.

1. User Interface (Presentation Layer): Built in Flutter for an engaging mobile experience.
2. Business Logic Layer: Manages state with Bloc/Cubit, Provider, GetX, and Redux for optimal performance.
3. Data Layer: Uses SQLite as the primary database, with `sqflite` for managing persistence and data access.
4. Security Layer: Implements `flutter_secure_storage` for secure data handling and user privacy.
5. Integration Layer: Supports HTTP connections for external APIs and data sources, using Flutter plugins for seamless connectivity.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: Flutter, Dart
- State Management: Bloc/Cubit, Provider, GetX, Redux
- Database: SQLite (`sqflite` package)
- Security: `flutter_secure_storage`
- Network Integration: HTTP connections with Flutter plugins
